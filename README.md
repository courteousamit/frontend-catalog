# FrontendCatalog

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.2.

To install it, you're going to need either the yarn package manager or the node package manager. 

To check whether or not you have npm, in your console / command line, type:
> npm -v

If this goes unrecognized (and not a version number), you need to install NodeJS from the below URL(https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Once you install NodeJS, reload your console or command line and you will have access to NPM.

Now, we can use NPM to install the Angular CLI. The Angular CLI has an official website located here.

To install it:
> npm install -g @angular/cli

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
